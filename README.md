# vim bits-n-bobs

A couple of vim related files I use, handy to have them on the cloud :)

## dotvimrc
My minimal(ish) `.vimrc` file.

## bluish.vim
Even more minimal vaguely dark-blue-themed vim color scheme.  Needs to live in ~/vim/colors.
Works on xterms too.  I only set the C/C++-related highlight colors.
