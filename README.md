# vim bits-n-bobs

A couple of vim related files I use, handy to have them on the cloud :)

## dotvimrc
My minimal(ish) `.vimrc` file.
20251004: Now even more minimal - no plugins but with a nice-looking (IMHO) status line including
the name of whatever C function or "area" of text you're in.

## colors/bluish.vim
Even more minimal vaguely dark-blue-themed vim color scheme.  Needs to live in ~/vim/colors.
Works on xterms too.
